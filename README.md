Generating registration code is just a part of the app

I'm just learning flask</br>
I can share the Api I've been trying to develop and also the desktop app for you to have an idea of what I'm trying to do</br>

Adrian2 is the Api I was trying to do by myself</br>

KairosHof is the desktop app I was trying to use to teach myself</br>
